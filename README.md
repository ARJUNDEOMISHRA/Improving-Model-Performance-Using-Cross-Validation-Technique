# Model Evaluation Using Cross-Validation in Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to evaluate machine learning models using
**Cross-Validation**, a robust technique that provides more reliable
performance estimates compared to a single train-test split.

Cross-validation helps reduce overfitting and ensures the model performs
well on unseen data.
